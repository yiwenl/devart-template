#Music - Technology

As with the sound effects, we felt the music should also take a procedural approach for this project, albeit with some limitations.

Whilst it would have been great to produce the entire score in a similar manner to the sound effects, with each instrument generated synthetically, it is much harder to achieve the desired level of quality that way. 

Instead, a hybrid approach where small sections, or cues of the music are pre-prepared (possibly as clips or scenes within [Ableton Live]('https://www.ableton.com/en/articles/getting-started-5-working-session-view/', 'Scenes within Ableton Live'), and triggered dynamically by the sound engine (likely PD). 

This technique gives us the benefit of using Ableton Live for both the composition environment and playback, whilst still giving us programmatic control via Pure Data, which can communicate with Ableton via MIDI or an OSC bridge.

#Music - Sketches & Inspiration

For the music, we wanted to try and produce a soundtrack that goes above and beyond ‘installation sound’ - treating it more like a film score than background ambience.

Here again we’re taking a large amount of inspiration from Journey, which has an incredible soundtrack, creating a sense of space, majesty and beauty - no pressure! 

A huge inspiration also is Jim Guthrie’s soundtrack to Sword & Sworcery: [link]('http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xls_H2FLJow', 'Sword & Sworcery')

Here’s some links to some musical sketches that were created at the beginning of the project:

*Involving synthesised strings and bowed guitar, which acted as a hint towards traditional Chinese instrumentation. It was, however, the first time the composer had played bowed guitar - it’s a bit squeaky!*

*an idea for the ‘morning’ segment of the piece, using a harpsichord played on a chromatic scale.*
