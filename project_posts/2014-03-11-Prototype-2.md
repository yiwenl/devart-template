#Prototype 2


The next step is to use the real elevation data we get from the elevation map to create mountains. The way to generate mountains is simple: we define a zone first, and just randomly pick a point within this zone, first we check if the pixel has reached the minimum brightness value request, and then we also checked if thereâ€™s already a mountain nearby. If pass both tests, then we add a new mountain to the map with this coordinate. Here are some pictures shows how this work :

on the left is the partial elevation map, on the right is the mountains found within this zone, and final 3D render using these data with random ink textures.

Testing with Japan.
