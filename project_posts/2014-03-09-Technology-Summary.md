#Technology Summary
###Node.js

We choose to use Node.js as our core server and build other parts around it. All the terrain  and weather data are stored in here and it will pass these data to frontend and sound module via OSC and websocket.

To get the elevation of the mountains we use an earth elevation map : 

![Example Image](project_images/summary/earth_height.jpg?raw=true "Example Image")

We convert the lat/lng information into x and y coordinates and read the pixel value from this map, the brighter the pixel is, the higher the mountain is going to be. Here is a quick test of 3D map using the values getting from this elevation map.

###Cinder - Frontend

We build the frontend with Cinder, which is a library build on top of c++. Itâ€™s a very useful library for creative coding and allow us to quickly create our prototypes and testings. The frontend update the visuals based on the geolocation and weather data. These data are send from the Node.js server using OSC.

###HTML5/Javascript - The controller
The controller is built with HTML5 and javascript. Based on a google map javascript api, we get the geolocation data from where user select and send it back to Node.js server using WebSocket. We also put another canvas overlay on top of the google map showing the position of the giant and also the camera.
