#Textures

The look of the experience mix different style and uses a lot of textures, which is a challenge to recreate in code. At the moment we are experimenting with various method to recreate the look of the mountains. The first prototype we’ve made looked good but the mountains were too flat. It will be great to create the mountain in 3D with their real height. We needed to find a way to create texture that can be applied in 3D. We came with the idea of recording an ink drop as texture as shown in this video:

The result is better than we expected, It created a great chinese’s ink style mountain.

So we went created more textures, experimenting and playing with different colours and different type of papers. A really interesting and fun process of creating textures. It takes some times to create them but watching the ink flows creating all kinds of beautiful shapes is really exciting. We all know the more randomness we throw into the code the more alive it will become. But there’s nothing can compare with the actual thing. It’s really nice to mix analogue method with coding. Every ink drop creates different shapes based on how thick is the ink, how high you drop them, how much water is on the paper, the flow of the water, the tiny different on the paper itself, it’s all these things that you cannot control which make it more beautiful. It also makes it feel very different once render in 3D.
