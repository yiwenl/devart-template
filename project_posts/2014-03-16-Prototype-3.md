http://youtu.be/JzRV7IlJlsg

YAY! We had our first projection testing today. We wanted to see how it feels once projected big.
Also in this build we started to integrate some of the style frame, background and ink textures. It  contain our first working version of 3D model of the giant. 

This prototype is controlled with a second device. Turns your finger on the mobile phone and the camera moves around. It is a very exciting step for us as the testing went very well. We are really happy with the look and the progression. Everything starts to come together, and it gets more and more exciting.
