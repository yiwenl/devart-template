#Prototype 1


We started with water ink textures to test, the mountain here is actually just simply a 2D image which does give a little feeling about the world we want to create, however we want to push a little bit more.

Then we discover that it is very interesting to use ink drop as a texture to put on a really 3D mountain.

So we begin to create our own textures and explore with different color themes.
