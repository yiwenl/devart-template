Weâ€™ve just been notified last night that we didn't make it. 

However we are really proud to be in the top 10, we are now even more motivated to finish the project than before. Thank you for your support, all the kind words and all the positive feedbacks. We are very flattered. Also thanks to Google and the Barbican for providing this platform and opportunity to show case our project.

For us this is not an end, we will only work even harder. This is another beginning!

Thank you everyone!

Yi-Wen & Bertrand
