## An interactive story of Kuafu’s myth

Read the full myth: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kua_Fu

Our project started from a discussion about myths and their values. We found Kuafu’s myth and both loved it. A powerful story of a giant that decides to catch the sun to put an end to a drought. A first style frame made for fun quickly turned into a full interactive story.

Our aim is to create this interactive journey through Google Maps, using its topographic data to render in real time the landscape and to use the Google Map itself as a way to navigate.

It's not a game but an explorable story.Our biggest challenge is to create our vision, to give life to this compelling and poetic story.

One of our inspiration is the game Journey: [link](‘http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mF8KkDiIdk', ‘Journey Music’)

The story  will be break into 3 chapters:

#### Chapter 1 The Raise 
This is the introduction to the journey. Kuafu wakes up, the sun raises and the mountains erect around him.

####Chapter 2 The Chase 
Once the introduction done the Giant starts to chase the sun from east to west. This is where user can start exploring the map. Guiding the Giant toward the sun. 
The landscape surrounding him will be created using the topographic data of Google Map. For example when Kuafu crosses the alp all the mountains will be rendered. Aswell as the mountain will keep other landscape features such as the sea and ocean which Kuafu will swim across.

####Chapter 3 The Fall
The end of the story,after a certain time Kuafu will fall of exhaustion and became a mountain - Your mountain. After naming your mountain your session will be finished.
